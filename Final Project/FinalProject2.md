There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the ground, but Denali could see movement. She squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what she had spied.

Then in the corner of her eye, she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again.

Balloons are pretty and come in different colors, different shapes, different sizes, and they can even adjust sizes as needed. But don't make them too big or they might just pop, and then bye-bye balloon. It'll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind.
